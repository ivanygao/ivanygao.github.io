      year: 2023-11-2024-04
      description:
        - Investigate on how various Influenza A virus (IAV) receptor organizations influence its mobility under the presence of antibody.
        - Implement a Julia-based simulation of filamentous IAV dynamics with periodic boundary conditions and restricted random movement.
        - Write a comprehensive report along with a demonstration poster which has been used to present at the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC) at the University of British Columbia.
        - Won first prize in the poster presentation at UBC MURC 2024 REX Awards (URO)

    - title: Lattice Boltzmann Method - Self-Directed Study
      year: 2023-03 to 2023-08
      description:
        - Conducted a comprehensive study using <i>Lattice Boltzmann Method - Fundamentals and Engineering Applications with Computer Codes</i> by A. A. Mohamad.
        - Developed a D2Q9 library using C++ and Julia to replicate textbook examples of non-isothermal incompressible fluid simulations.
        - Implemented OpenCL and OpenMP to achieve faster computational speeds, making the iteration process 5 times faster. Now able to iterate over a 3000 x 3000 grid with the D2Q9 lattice in 11 seconds on an Intel UHD 620 chip.
